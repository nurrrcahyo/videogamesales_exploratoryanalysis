# Video Game Sales - Exploratory Analysis

## IntroductionÂ¶

As a gamer, it's such a pleasure to stumble upon this digital treasure of a dataset. Thanks to the man, Ulrik, for providing us this. It allows me to a little bit indulge in nostalgia by revisiting a lot of old titles of happy-childhood games of mine and to develop my skill as an analyst of data.

We will see what genre, what title in what platforms that has the most sales. We will also see what year saw the most games released
